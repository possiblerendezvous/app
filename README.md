# Possible Rendezvous

## Project Idea

[Possible Rendezvous](http://possiblerendezvous.com/) is a web application that arranges appointments of two “random” anonymous persons. 
Each registered app user receives an invitation to rendezvous with any other random user, in a random place, at a random time. 
The combination (time/place/meeting partners) results algorithmically with the help of the pseudorandom number generator. 
App users have no control over the specifics. 
They can decide to accept the appointment or not, but if they so desire, the app will send them – at their own risk – on a journey towards obscurity.
